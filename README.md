# 🐍 Python Algorithms & Interview Prep

Welcome to this repository! This collection is designed to help you master Python algorithms and prepare for technical interviews, with a specific focus on progressive learning paths (like EPAM's interview process).

## 📚 Core Resources

We have structured the learning material into two main guides:

### 1. [Python Algorithm Roadmap](./python_algorithm_roadmap.md)
A complete "Zero to Hero" roadmap for Python and Algorithmics.
- **Level 1-2**: Basics & Data Structures (Lists, Dicts, Sets)
- **Level 3-4**: Algorithms, Recursion & Backtracking
- **Level 5-7**: Dynamic Programming, Graphs & LeetCode patterns

### 2. [EPAM Progressive Exercises](./epam_progressive_exercises.md)
A targeted set of exercises designed to build specific skills required for data manipulation tasks often found in interviews (e.g., filtering, grouping, and aggregating data from lists of dictionaries).
- **Levels 1-5**: From basic filtering to complex multi-criteria grouping.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Pick a Roadmap**: Start with the [Algorithm Roadmap](./python_algorithm_roadmap.md) if you are refreshing basics, or dive into [Progressive Exercises](./epam_progressive_exercises.md) if you want specific data manipulation practice.
2. **Practice Locally**:
   - Create a new `.py` file for each exercise (e.g., `1.1.py`, `recursion_practice.py`).
   - Run your code using python:
     ```bash
     python3 your_script.py
     ```
3. **Verify**: Compare your outputs with the expected results listed in the specific exercise section.

## 📂 File Structure

- `python_algorithm_roadmap.md`: General study guide.
- `epam_progressive_exercises.md`: Specific interview drill.
- `*.py`: Your practice files (e.g., `1.1.py`, `2.1.py`).

Happy Coding! 🚀
